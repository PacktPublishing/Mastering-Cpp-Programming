# Mastering C++ Programming
This is the code repository for [Mastering C++ Programming](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/mastering-c-programming?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781786461629), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
C++ has come a long way and has now been adopted in several contexts. Its key strengths are its software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications. The C++ 17 release will change the way developers write code, and this book will help you master your developing skills with C++. With real-world, practical examples explaining each concept, the book will begin by introducing you to the latest features in C++ 17. It encourages clean code practices in C++ in general, and demonstrates the GUI app-development options in C++. You’ll get tips on avoiding memory leaks using smart-pointers. Next, you’ll see how multi-threaded programming can help you achieve concurrency in your applications. Moving on, you’ll get an in-depth understanding of the C++ Standard Template Library. We show you the concepts of implementing TDD and BDD in your C++ programs, and explore template-based generic programming, giving you the expertise to build powerful applications. Finally, we’ll round up with debugging techniques and best practices.By the end of the book, you’ll have an in-depth understanding of the language and its various facets.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <mutex>
#include "Account.h"
using namespace std;
enum ThreadType {
  DEPOSITOR,
  WITHDRAWER
};
mutex locker;
```

You will need to be equipped with the following tools before you get started with the book:
g++ compiler of version 5.4.0 20160609 or above
GDB 7.11.1
Valgrind 3.11.0
Cucumber-cpp Git 2.7.4
Google test framework (gtest 1.6 or later)
CMake 3.5.1
Ruby 2.5.1
Qt 5.7.0
Bundler v 1.14.6
The OS required is Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit or later. The hardware configuration should at least be of 1 GB RAM and 20 GB disk space. A virtual machine with this configuration should also suffice.
